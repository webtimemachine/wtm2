## Build

The extension needs to be built separately for Chrome and Firefox. The build process ensures that the output files match the declarations made in the manifest files.

### Build for Chrome

To build the extension for Chrome:

```bash
npm run build:chrome
```

This command generates a `dist` folder compatible with the Chrome browser in a folder named `app_chrome`.

### Build for Firefox

To build the extension for Firefox:

```bash
npm run build:firefox
```

This command generates a `dist` folder compatible with the Firefox browser in a folder named `app_firefox`.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will run all the tests configured with Jest. The project uses `@testing-library/react` for testing React components.

## Configuration

### Vite Configuration

The extension uses a custom Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) to handle different build outputs for Chrome and Firefox. The configuration dynamically selects the manifest file based on the `BROWSER` environment variable.

### Manifest Files

Two separate manifest files are used for Chrome and Firefox:

- **`manifest-chrome.ts`**: Configuration specific to Chrome, including content scripts, permissions, and content security policies.
- **`manifest-firefox.ts`**: Configuration specific to Firefox, including browser-specific settings for Gecko, background scripts, and permissions.
