# Contribution Guidelines

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use Feature branches and the PR to main

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, you have to add tests too.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/webtimemachine/wtm2/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/webtimemachine/wtm2/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and an example

When reporting a bug, please provide a clear description of the expected behavior and the actual behavior you encountered. Adding an example could be usefull.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We're using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.

## License
