      <h2>Web Time Machine Extension Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy describes how Web Time Machine Extension ("we", "our" or "the extension") collects, uses,
        and shares the personal information of users ("you" or "your") in connection with the use of our extension in
        Google Chrome and Safari browsers on iOS devices.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Collection and use of information</strong></p>
      <p>The Web Time Machine extension primarily aims to allow users to sync their browsing history between Google
        Chrome
        and Safari browsers. To achieve this, the extension saves information about the web pages visited by the user
        and
        keeps this history synchronized between both browsers. This information includes the date of visit, URL, title,
        and content of web pages.</p>
      <p>The extension only collects personal information when the user logs into the extension by providing their email
        address. This information is used solely to identify the user and associate their browsing history with their
        account.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Use of information</strong></p>
      <p>All information collected by the extension is used solely to provide and improve browsing history
        synchronization
        services between Google Chrome and Safari browsers. The user's personal information is not shared with third
        parties and is only accessible by the user.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Cookies and tracking technologies</strong></p>
      <p>The Web Time Machine extension does not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about
        users.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Information Protection</strong></p>
      <p>We value the privacy and security of our users' information. Therefore, we implement security measures to
        protect
        personal information collected by the extension.</p>
      <p><strong>5. User rights</strong></p>
      <p>Users have the right to access, rectify, and delete their personal information stored by the extension. They
        can
        do this by deleting logs of their browsing history through the extension's user interface.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Contact</strong></p>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy or your use of the Web Time Machine extension,
        you
        can contact us through the extension's <a href="https://github.com/webtimemachine/wtm2">GitHub repository</a>.
