# WebTM Web Page

The WebTM web page is a fully functional, standalone web application built with Next.js. Initially developed as a port of the Chrome extension's popup content, it has evolved into its own project with a responsive UI for both desktop and mobile devices. This web page allows users to log in, view their data, and use WebTM features without needing to install the browser extension.
